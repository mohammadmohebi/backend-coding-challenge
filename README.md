# City search

By parsing and indexing a city list inside a text file provided by Geonames, it's possible, through a REST API, to request for nearby large cities.
(inspired by https://github.com/busbud/coding-challenge-backend-c)

## Indexing algorithm

The application has its own database. The indexing algorithm is custom made, but inspired by the `suffix tree` algorithm to index data for a fast search.

Because the example file is not large, everything is in the memory but for real-life use case, all indexing should be saved in a file or files and consulted only when needed.

## Scoring algorithm

The algorithm uses these three criteria to give a score from 0 to 1:

```
score = dw * 0.4 + qs * 0.3 + qd * 0.3
```

- `dw` : relative weight of the distance between the search result and the original coordinate(given in the request). The weight is estimated by considering that 1Â° is equal to 111km (even if we know that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but we don't need to be precise here). The distance is calculated until 500Km. If it exceeds 500Km, the score of this variable is 0
- `qs` : size of query relative to the size of the found city. The score is better when the two strings have the same size.
- `qd` : position of the query inside the city name. A position of 0 inside the city name has a better score.
